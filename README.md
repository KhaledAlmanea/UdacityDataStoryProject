# UdacityDataStoryProject
Baseball data is A data set that contain 1,157 baseball players, my goal is to create visualization to analyze the performance of players and to demonstrate if the different attributes affect their performance. And the attributes that are included are their handedness (right or left handed), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.
Result and Findings:
• The bar chart shows that the on average left-handed players are scoring more but their count is less than right handed by 421.
• At a range between 0.1 to 0.32 of Avg the median for the left-handed group is higher by 0.1 than the other handed groups.
• The median value of home runs scored by left handed players is approx. 50% more than other handed groups.
• 5 of the top 10 players are left handed and the top 1 player is left handed.
• There is a positive relationship between Avg and HR which means left handed players they mostly perform better than the other handed group because of having higher Avg on average.
